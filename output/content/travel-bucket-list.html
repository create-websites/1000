    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Earth Tones -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard with four main thematic sections accessible via a sticky top navigation, mirroring the report's core structure but enabling non-linear exploration. This structure was chosen because the source report is a collection of distinct but related travel concepts, best explored based on user interest rather than a linear read. The user can select a theme (e.g., Natural World), then filter by sub-category (e.g., Mountains, Waterways). Content is presented in a card-based system; clicking a card reveals detailed information in a modal window. The 'Urban Experience' section features a dynamic bar chart, allowing users to interactively compare cities based on various metrics from the report's index. This dashboard approach transforms the static report into a user-driven tool for discovery and comparison, enhancing usability and engagement. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The report contains qualitative descriptions of destinations and quantitative data on cities. Goal: To make both types of information digestible and interactive. Viz/Presentation Method: For qualitative descriptions (destinations, cultures), interactive cards are used. For quantitative data (Global Urbanist's Index), a dynamic bar chart is used. Interaction: Cards are clickable to reveal more info in a modal. The bar chart has buttons to re-sort the data by different metrics (Livability, Prosperity, etc.). Justification: This separation of presentation methods is ideal. Cards allow for focused reading on demand without cluttering the main view. The interactive chart makes the numerical data from the table much more engaging and easier to compare than a static list. Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas) for the chart, Vanilla JS for all DOM manipulation (card interactions, filtering, modals). -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
