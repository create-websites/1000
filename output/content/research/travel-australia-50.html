    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive dashboard. The core user experience centers on a dynamic filtering system where users can select a 'Travel Style' (e.g., Urban, Wilderness, Coastal). This instantly updates a grid of destination cards and summary charts. Clicking a card opens a modal with in-depth information. This non-linear, task-oriented design was chosen to empower users to explore the report's rich content based on their personal interests, making it more engaging and useful than a static, linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Master list of destinations -> Goal: Organize/Compare -> Viz: Filterable Card Grid (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: User clicks filters to update grid -> Justification: Allows for rapid, personalized discovery. | Report Info: Distribution of destination types -> Goal: Inform/Summarize -> Viz: Don't Chart & Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Charts update dynamically with filters -> Justification: Provides a high-level visual overview of the selected travel style. | Report Info: Detailed destination descriptions/logistics -> Goal: Inform in Detail -> Viz: Modal Window (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Opens on card click -> Justification: Delivers comprehensive content without cluttering the primary interface. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
