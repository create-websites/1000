    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A filter-driven, single-page application. The core is a control panel with filters for travel style (appeal) and region, plus a search bar. This controls a responsive grid of destination cards. This design prioritizes user-led discovery over the linear structure of the source report. It allows users to instantly query the dataset based on their specific interests. Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information, keeping the user in a single, fluid experience without page reloads. This interactive dashboard structure is superior for usability as it turns passive reading into an active exploration tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report data is transformed into interactive elements. The Master Index becomes the filterable card grid (Goal: Organize/Compare, Method: JS filter on data array, Justification: Active user control). High-level data is summarized in two charts: a donut chart for Primary Appeal and a bar chart for Regions (Goal: Inform/Summarize, Method: Chart.js/Canvas, Justification: Quick visual overview). Detailed descriptions are placed in modals (Goal: Inform in detail, Method: JS-powered modal, Justification: Reduces clutter, maintains user context). This structure fully supports the interactive dashboard design. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
