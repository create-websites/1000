    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals & Earth Tones) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive "Fortress Explorer," transforming the report into a dynamic discovery tool. The core user flow is organized around thematic exploration rather than linear reading. It starts with a section on the "Evolution of Defense," using interactive cards to explain the shift from concentric to bastion forts. The main section, the "Global Pantheon," allows users to filter a grid of forts by "Architectural Style" or "Traveler Experience," making the data instantly accessible and personal. Clicking a fort opens a modal with detailed, tabbed information. This is more engaging than a simple list and allows for comparative analysis. The app concludes with a dedicated section on "Living Heritage," exploring the modern roles and preservation challenges of these sites. This structure guides the user from understanding core concepts to exploring examples and finally to appreciating their modern relevance. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Defensive Philosophies (Concentric vs. Bastion) -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz/Method: Interactive 'before-and-after' style cards with diagrams created using HTML/CSS. -> Interaction: Hovering or clicking reveals details about each design. -> Justification: Simplifies a complex architectural evolution into a clear, visual comparison. Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS. | Report Info: Table of Featured Fortifications -> Goal: Organize & Filter -> Viz/Method: A filterable grid of cards. -> Interaction: Users click filter buttons to dynamically sort the grid. -> Justification: Turns a static table into a powerful, user-driven discovery tool. Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS. | Report Info: Fort Details -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: A detailed modal with tabbed content. -> Justification: Organizes extensive information (History, Architecture, Visitor Guide) into a clean, digestible format without leaving the main page.

            1: {
                history: `Arguably the most significant and best-preserved Crusader castle, its legendary status began in 1142 when given to the Knights Hospitaller. It commanded the critical Homs Gap and earned a reputation for impregnability, withstanding numerous attacks before falling to a deception in 1271.`,
                architecture: `The quintessential concentric castle, with two massive defensive walls separated by a moat. This layered defense allowed defenders on the taller inner wall to fire over those on the outer wall. It represents the pinnacle of Crusader military engineering.`,
                guide: `Located near Homs, Syria. Due to the ongoing civil war, the country is a high-risk area. Any visit should only be considered with extreme caution through official, reputable tour operators with up-to-date security knowledge. The site is on the UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger.`
            },
            2: {
                history: `A focal point of Scottish history since the 11th century, it has been a royal residence, military garrison, and a prison, enduring numerous sieges during the Wars of Scottish Independence. It remains an active military base and a powerful symbol of the nation.`,
                architecture: `Its primary defense is its natural position atop an extinct volcanic plug. The architecture is a composite, reflecting centuries of additions. Key structures include the 12th-century St. Margaret's Chapel (oldest building in Edinburgh) and the 16th-century Half Moon Battery.`,
                guide: `Located at the top of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Open daily, but booking tickets online in advance is essential. The terrain is steep and cobbled. A mobility vehicle is available on request to access upper levels.`
            },
            4: {
                history: `Known as the "White Heron Castle," it is the finest surviving example of 17th-century Japanese castle architecture. Miraculously, it was never damaged in battle and survived WWII bombing, making it one of only twelve original castles left in Japan.`,
                architecture: `A masterpiece of function and form. Its brilliant white, fire-resistant plaster exterior and elegant design are complemented by a labyrinthine defensive layout of gates and paths designed to trap and confuse attackers, exposing them to fire from loopholes and stone-dropping windows.`,
                guide: `Located in Himeji City, accessible via a short walk or bus ride from the Shinkansen station. A tour takes 1.5-2 hours. The keep has very steep, narrow wooden stairs.`
            },
            5: {
                history: `The "Fort of the Sun" has been the stronghold of the Rathore clan since 1459. It looms over Jodhpur from a 125m cliff and its walls bear the marks of cannonball fire, a testament to centuries of conflict with rival clans and the Mughal Empire.`,
                architecture: `A quintessential Rajput hill fort that blends seamlessly with the landscape. Inside the imposing walls are a series of magnificent palaces renowned for their intricate sandstone carvings and delicate latticed screens (jalis), showcasing the zenith of Rajput craftsmanship.`,
                guide: `Open daily. The entry fee includes an excellent audio guide. An elevator is available to assist with the steep ascent. Plan 2-3 hours to explore the museum and palaces.`
            },
            7: {
                history: `For over 400 years, "El Morro" was Spain's most critical military outpost in the Caribbean. Starting as a simple tower in 1539, it evolved into a formidable six-level bastion fort designed to create a devastating crossfire against any ship entering San Juan Bay.`,
                architecture: `An outstanding example of Spanish colonial military engineering. Its design is a direct response to naval artillery, with massive 18-foot-thick walls and tiered batteries. The iconic domed sentry boxes, or garitas, have become a cultural symbol of Puerto Rico.`,
                guide: `Part of the San Juan National Historic Site. The entrance fee is valid for 24 hours and includes access to the nearby Castillo San Cristóbal. Payments are cashless. Allow 1-2 hours for a self-guided tour.`
            },
            11: {
                history: `Famed for two historical layers: first as a magnificent palace-fortress built by Herod the Great around 37 BCE, and second as the site of the legendary last stand of 960 Jewish rebels against the Romans in 73 CE, who chose mass suicide over capture.`,
                architecture: `A natural fortress on an isolated rock plateau. Herod augmented its sheer cliffs with a casemate wall and built a stunning three-tiered Northern Palace that hangs off the cliff face. The most complete Roman siege works in the world, including a massive assault ramp, survive at its base.`,
                guide: `Located near the Dead Sea. Ascend via the steep "Snake Path" hike or by cable car. Visit early in the morning to avoid intense desert heat. A museum and sound & light show are also on site.`
